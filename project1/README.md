# Project 1

The code is contained in the [scripts](scripts) folder.  
The subfolder [toolbox](scripts/toolbox) contains files implementing the building blocks of a complete ML pipeline.  
The pipeline, including model selection, is implemented in the notebook [project1.ipynb](scripts/project1.ipynb), located at the top level; the script [run.py](scripts/run.py) contains the same pipeline, without model selection (the best parameters are copied from the notebook).  

Following is the description of each file.
